## üöÄ Features

- **Interactive 3D Visuals**: Leveraging `react-three-fiber` and `@react-three/drei` to create immersive 3D scenes, including Earth, Satellite, and UFO models.
- **Dynamic Experience Section**: A visually engaging timeline of professional experience, featuring tools, locations, and accomplishments with custom icons and animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for all screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions, hover effects, and particle animations using CSS keyframes and cubic-bezier easing.
- **Thematic Consistency**: A modern, dark-themed UI with custom CSS variables for colors, typography, and reusable design tokens.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Lazy loading of assets, efficient animations, and optimized rendering for 3D models.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Includes a `manifest.json` and service worker for offline capabilities and mobile installation.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows a **component-based architecture** using React. The structure is modular and scalable, ensuring maintainability and reusability of components.


---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript for improved developer productivity and code quality.
- **react-three-fiber**: React renderer for Three.js, enabling 3D graphics and animations.
- **@react-three/drei**: Helper library for common 3D tasks like loading models and creating controls.
- **Three.js**: 3D library for rendering and animating 3D models.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped and reusable CSS for styling components.
- **Devicons-react**: Icon library for displaying technology logos dynamically.

### Performance & Optimization
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamically load assets and components to improve initial load time.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS media queries and `clamp()` for adaptive layouts.
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic for viewport detection and container height calculations.

### Build Tools
- **Create React App**: Boilerplate for React projects with Webpack, Babel, and ESLint pre-configured.
- **Service Worker**: PWA support for offline capabilities.

## üìÇ Key Components

### 3D Models
- **Earth**: [Earth.tsx]([src/Components/Earth.tsx](https://github.com/sddiaz/Personal-Website/blob/main/personal-website/src/Components/Earth.tsx)) - Interactive 3D Earth model rendered using `react-three-fiber`.
- **Satellite**: [Satellite.tsx](src/Components/Satellite.tsx) - Satellite model with animations.
- **UFO**: [Ufo.tsx](src/Components/Ufo.tsx) - UFO model with dynamic lighting and effects.

### Experience Section
- **Dynamic Cards**: [Experience.tsx](src/Pages/Experience/Experience.tsx) - Displays professional experience with tools, locations, and accomplishments.
- **Custom Icons**: Dynamically rendered icons using `devicons-react`.

## üìà Scalability & Best Practices

- **Reusable Components**: Modular design ensures components can be reused across the application.
- **Thematic Consistency**: CSS variables and design tokens for consistent styling.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes for improved accessibility.
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering of 3D models and animations for smooth user experience.

## üèÜ Why This Project Stands Out

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
1. Implement **interactive 3D graphics** to create engaging user experiences.
2. Follow **best practices** in software engineering, including modular architecture, responsive design, and accessibility.
3. Optimize for **real-world performance** with lazy loading, efficient animations, and responsive layouts.
